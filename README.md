# 2x2 Rubik's Cube Solver

2x2 Rubik's Cube solver using A* Search algorithm and heuristics. The program works for a limited number of initial moves.

See the full [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/leovergaramarq/2x2-rubik-cube-solver/blob/main/2x2_rubik_cube_solver.ipynb) with the implementation.

# How to Use

1. Open the [2x2_rubik_cube_solver.ipynb](https://github.com/leovergaramarq/2x2-rubik-cube-solver/blob/main/2x2_rubik_cube_solver.ipynb) file using a Jupyter Notebook environment (Google Colab, Visual Studio Code, etc.).

2. In the [rubiks-cube-solver.com/2x2/](https://rubiks-cube-solver.com/2x2/) site, do the rotations/scrambling and take a screenshot of the expanded cube. Make sure to include the cube only. Save the image as PNG.
